## Introduction

Blogster is an extendable CLI tool allowing you to your write blog posts once in Markdown and then publish them on
multiple platforms in a single command.

### Highlights

- Posts written in Markdown
- Crosspost to [Medium][medium] and [Dev.to][devto]
- Automatic conversion between inline code blocks and embedded gists
- Changes visualization between local and published posts

## Installation

Install via `npm`:

```bash
npm install @blogster/cli --save-dev
```

Then, since Blogster is useless without plugins, you have to install some of them too:

| Plugins                                     |                                                      |
| :------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| [@blogster/plugin-devto][devto-plugin-gh]   | [![npm][devto-plugin-npm-badge]][devto-plugin-npm]   |
| [@blogster/plugin-medium][medium-plugin-gh] | [![npm][medium-plugin-npm-badge]][medium-plugin-npm] |

## Getting started

Assuming youâ€™ve successfully [installed the Blogster CLI](#installation) you are now ready to write and publish your
first post.

In this example, we will configure Blogster to publish to both [Medium][medium] and [Dev.to][devto] so make sure
[@blogster/plugin-devto][devto-plugin-gh] and [@blogster/plugin-medium][medium-plugin-gh] are installed too.

### Step 1: Add a post file

First, let's create a new Markdown file for our post. In our case, this new file will be added under
`posts/sample-post/post.md`, but it can be everywhere you want.

Now, open up your favorite IDE and some content to our `post.md` file:

```markdown
---
title: Never Return Null Again

tags:
  - first-post
  - blogster
  - so-excited
---

## Hi there!

This is my first post published with [Blogster](https://github.com/maximegel/blogster)! ðŸŽ‰
```

Noticed the [YAML front matter](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2760395) separated by `---` at the top? Blogster
use this metadata to track and publish your posts.

> _Warning:_  
> Blogster uses the `title` metadata to match your local posts with your published posts, so make sure the title used in
> your post file is the same for all of your published posts

### Step 2: Add a configuration file

Add a `.blogsterrc.json` file at the root of your project and add the locations of your post files as well as the
installed plugins:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@blogster/plugin-devto", "@blogster/plugin-medium"],
  "include": ["posts/**/post.md"]
}
```

For all available options see the [configuration](#configuration).

### Step 3: Set environment variables

Because we are using [@blogster/plugin-devto][devto-plugin-gh] and [@blogster/plugin-medium][medium-plugin-gh]
we need some tokens/keys to be set as environment variables.

To obtain them, please follow these steps:

- [Generate a Medium access token](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs#21-self-issued-access-tokens)
- [Generate a Dev.to API key](https://docs.dev.to/api/#getting-an-api-key)
- [Generate a GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

> _Info_: The GitHub token is used to replace code blocks by embeded Gists while publishing to Medium.

Once you did this, create a `.env` file at the root of your project and add your previously generated tokens/keys:

```text
BLOGSTER_MEDIUM_TOKEN="YOUR SECRET TOKEN"
BLOGSTER_DEVTO_API_KEY="YOUR SECRET KEY"
BLOGSTER_GH_TOKEN="YOUR SECRET TOKEN"
```

> _Danger_: **Do not commit your `.env` file!**

### Step 4: Publish your post

Congrats! The only things left his to publish our post and it is sample as:

```bash
npx bgs push
```

## Command line

To run a command, youâ€™ll need to prefix each command in order to properly locate the executable:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/bgs [options] [command]
```

Or you can use npx (requires [npm@5.2.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm/v/5.2.0) or greater):

```bash
npx bgs [options] [command]
```

For all available commands run:

```bash
npx bgs --help
```

## Configuration

The default behavior of Blogster can be modified by supplying any of the configuration options:

| Option    | Default | Description                                                                           |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plugins` | `[]`    | A list of plugin names e.g. `@blogster/plugin-medium`                                 |
| `env`     | `[]`    | Any values to be set as environment variables                                         |
| `include` | `[]`    | A list of filenames or patterns to include in tracked blog posts e.g. `posts/**/*.md` |
| `exclude` | `[]`    | A list of filenames or patterns to exclude from tracked blog posts                    |

Thanks to [Cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig), the configuration can be loaded from
either of the following places:

- a `blogster` property in package.json
- a `.blogsterrc` file in JSON or YAML format
- a `.blogsterrc.json`, `.blogsterrc.yaml`, `.blogsterrc.yml`, `.blogsterrc.js`, or `.blogsterrc.cjs` file
- a `blogster.config.js` or `blogster.config.cjs` CommonJS module exporting an object

## Environment variables

Environment variables are used by plugins to load extra configuration required by them.

Take a look at the documentation of each installed plugin to find out which environment variables you need.

There are 3 different ways to set environment variables:

- [Set in your configuration file](#option-1-configuration-file)
- [Export as `BLOGSTER_*`](#option-2-blogster)
- [Create a `.env` file](#option-3-dotenv)

### Option 1: configuration file

Any key/value you set in your configuration file (e.g. `.blogsterrc.json`) under the `env` key will become an
environment variable:

```json
"env": {
  "myBlogUrl": "https://my-blog.com"
}
```

### Option 2: `BLOGSTER_*`

Any OS-level environment variable on your machine that starts with either `BLOGSTER_` or `blogster_` will automatically
be added to environment variables.

Blogster will strip off the `BLOGSTER_` and convert the remaining part to camel-case when adding your environment
variables.

### Option 3: dotenv

Thanks to [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), Blogster will loads environment variables from a `.env` file as
if they were native environment variables (see: [option #2](#option-2-blogster)).

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form
of `NAME=VALUE`. For example:

```text
BLOGSTER_MY_BLOG_URL="https://my-blog.com"
```
